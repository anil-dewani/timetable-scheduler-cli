# Automatic Time-Table Generator for educational institutions

This program generates unique time-table for each Class divisions, when sufficient inputs are provided.

The project “Automatic time-table generator for educational institutes” is software to generate unique time-tables for each and every class. The software asks for following inputs in order to generate unique time-tables for each class.

Total number of periods in a day
Time Duration for each period
Total number of recess
Recess Periods
Total number of subjects
Name of each subject
Total number of class
Name of each class
Whether it is allowed to have same subject more than once in a day or not?

After providing sufficient inputs, the software generates time-tables which are unique and can directly be implemented within educational institutions. It generates time-table for all class divisions and it also handles recess periods efficiently.

After the time-table is generated it asks the user for following options

Save Project
Back to menu
Export HTML
Next Table

Save Project: - This option again asks the user for the project name they want to give to the project. It saves the project for future references. User can load the same project again from the project in case they want to refer to the time-tables again in future. Hence there is no need to copy time-table down to a paper or another file on computer. The software saves all the data for the user.

Back to menu: - This option takes the user back to the main menu. They can either create a new project; load existing project or exit from the main menu.

Export HTML: - This is one of the most useful features in our software. It helps the user to export their project as an HTML file so that they can directly print from there and paste it to their notice boards. This feature asks for a name of the file. Once the input is provided, the software creates the html file with that name and shows all the time-tables in proper format to the user in that HTML file. User can directly click on “print” to take a print out of the page and cut down the time-tables and paste it on notice-board. It makes all the stuff easy for the users.

Next Table: - The software by default shows only one time-table on the screen. If there are more than one class then, Next Table option will be available and users can use it to move to the time-table of next class. Hence, they can browse all time-tables within the application itself.

Users are not only able to generate new projects but also able to save their projects and browse them later. The second option from menu is used to list all the saved projects and load a selected project again.

Loading a project will show all time-table again on the screen. It will have same options as before but with just one change. Instead of saving the project, the user will be able to delete the project. Deleting the project removes the project data forever from our data file. Hence, this option should be used carefully.
